    "\n",
    "In these exercises we first learned to construct a matrix as a numpy array by assembling column vectors without using python lists as an aid which is a useful tool for assemling the data matrix in machine learning. We furthmore learned and worked with how the norms are defined and implemented, both on a low level as well as a higher level using the matrix multiplication operator. The importance of this was then illustrated through its relation to the cost function, where the common RMSE and MAE functions where construced through use of the previous norm functions. This implementation and process clearly illustrated the defintion and meaning of the loss functions as well as how they could be coded by working from the ground up. Lastly, the importance of data validation was also discussed and a fail-fast approach was implemented in the code to make sure any error is appears as quickly as possible. These are all very important machine learning concept, which concerns the fundamental coding and understanding of how the processes works. The overall learning outcomes of the exercises could thereby be said to be basic understanding of the python implementation of vector-matrix formulations along with a fundamental understanding of how the loss functions are build up and an introduction to fail-fast approach. \n"
